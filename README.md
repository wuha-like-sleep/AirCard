## Features
- 🎨 **Custom Card Skins:** Assign custom artwork, textures, or bank logos to Apple Pay and Wallet cards.
- 🔢 **Lock Screen Passcode Themes (.passthm):** Apply custom keypad button artwork from popular `.passthm` themes directly to iOS 18+ lockscreen.
- 🧩 **Passcode Theme Creator:** Create custom themes from a single wallpaper (Seamless Poster Slicing) or build key-by-key (Individual Keys).
- 🔍 **Interactive Photo Framing:** Pan and zoom artwork directly inside keypad buttons with real-time iPhone preview.
- ✏️ **Edit Existing .passthm Themes:** Open any Cowabunga or Nugget theme package directly in the creator, tweak button artwork, reposition photos, and re-export or flash.
- ⚡ **Per-Card & Bulk Customization:** Set unique artwork for each card or apply one design across all cards with a single click.
- 📱 **Zero-Hassle Card Detection:** Tap any card in your iPhone's Wallet app to detect its hash in real-time.
- 🚀 **100% Standalone (Universal):** Native support for both **Apple Silicon** and **Intel (x86)** Macs. All required device-communication utilities and image engines are pre-bundled inside the app.
- 📦 **Nothing to install by hand:** No Homebrew or Python packages. AirCard uses the Python 3 from Apple's Command Line Tools, and if they are missing it tells you the one command that installs them.

## Installation

### macOS (Universal DMG)
1. Download **`AirCard.dmg`** from [Releases](https://github.com/mak5er/AirCard/releases).
2. Open `AirCard.dmg` and drag **`AirCard.app`** into your **Applications** folder. If Finder asks, choose **Replace**, not **Keep Both**: cards, saved originals and the skin library live outside the app and are kept. Opened from anywhere else, AirCard offers to move itself into Applications and to clear out older copies.
3. Fully compatible with both **Apple Silicon** and **Intel (x86)** Macs.

> [!NOTE]
> **First launch.** A build signed with a Developer ID and notarised by Apple opens normally. A build that is not (the default when you build it yourself) is stopped by macOS the first time:
> - **macOS 15 or later:** open AirCard once and click **Done**. In **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll to **Security** and click **Open Anyway** next to the AirCard message and confirm with your password.
> - **macOS 14:** Control-click `AirCard.app` in Applications, choose **Open**, then click **Open**.
> - **"AirCard is damaged":** run this in Terminal, then open it again:
>   ```sh
>   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AirCard.app
>   ```

## How to Customize Apple Wallet Cards
1. Connect your iPhone with a cable that carries data. Unlock it and tap **Trust**. If your Mac asks whether to allow the accessory, click **Allow**.
2. In AirCard, stay on the **Apple Wallet** tab and click **Scan Cards**.
3. On your iPhone:
   - **Double-click the Side (Power) button** to open Apple Pay.
   - Authenticate with **Face ID**.
   - **Tap your card** (or tap it once more) to trigger instant detection!
4. Click **Read Original Designs** to keep a copy of each card as it is now, so it can be put back later.
5. Click a card, or drop a picture onto it, and frame it in the designer. To reuse pictures, open **Skin Library** and import a pack from a zip, a folder or a link.
6. Click **Flash Skins**.
7. Force-close the **Wallet** app on your iPhone from the App Switcher (or restart the iPhone) to see your new card design.

### If scanning finds no cards

The scanner uses the iPhone's unified log service, including Info/Debug events.
On iOS 18.6.2, the legacy log service can show Wallet activity while omitting the
resource lookup messages that contain card identifiers.

Open **Log** and check for `Connected to the unified device log stream`, then
double-click the side button, authenticate, and tap or switch cards. If the log
reader stops, reconnect and unlock the iPhone, then start another scan. Values
that iOS replaces with `<private>` cannot be recovered by the scanner.

If your device previously connected but scanning found zero cards, please try
this build and report whether it helps. Include your iPhone model, iOS version,
macOS version, and the AirCard version or commit tested. Avoid posting full
device logs or card identifiers. See [scanner validation](docs/wallet-card-detection.md)
for the verified environment and remaining coverage.

## How to Apply Lockscreen Passcode Themes (.passthm)
1. Switch to the **Passcode Themes** tab at the top of AirCard.
2. Drag & drop any `.passthm` file into the app (or click **Choose .passthm File**).
3. AirCard will inspect the theme and display an interactive preview on the numeric keypad (0–9, *, #).
4. Click **Apply Passcode Theme**.
5. Restart your iPhone to reload the lock screen cache and see your custom passcode buttons!

> [!TIP]
> **Universal Language & Bold Text Support:**  
> AirCard automatically expands and flashes custom keypad assets for all system locales (English, Ukrainian, Russian, Spanish, German, French, etc.) and generates both standard and **Bold Text** cache bitmaps (`--white` and `--white-bold`), ensuring your theme works regardless of your iOS language or accessibility display settings!

## Building from Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mak5er/AirCard.git
cd AirCard
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
This builds universal binaries (`arm64` + `x86_64`), bundles dependencies into `build/AirCard.app`, and outputs `build/AirCard.dmg`.
